## Background

### Problem Statement

Entrepreneurs and innovators often struggle to identify promising startup ideas that can have a huge impact on society and also validate them. Existing resources do not effectively aggregate new ideas from diverse sources and/or do not include the validation step, or offer at the same time a collaborative space for discussion, ranking, and quick iteration. As a result, good ideas may never reach the right audience, and potential collaborators miss valuable opportunities to connect.

### Project Overview

*The Way Forward* aims to address this problem by creating a centralized platform where users can easily discover, discuss, and refine high-impact startup ideas in various sectors. The platform consists of four main areas:

- Ideas Portal: A central hub where ideas are collected and users can interact with them. Ideas come from interviews, user submissions, and AI agents that crawl specific web resources (e.g., LinkedIn, Reddit, Hacker News) to identify needs and generate ideas. Each idea follows a structured format with consistent fields (title, category, subcategory, difficulty, market estimates, sources, etc.). Users can vote on ideas, post comments, and form interest groups. A premium model offers direct contact features for deeper collaboration. This is the platform's core offering.
- Podcast: A curated list of "The Way Forward" podcast episodes, available on Spotify and YouTube. Each 20-30 minute episode features an industry expert discussing their sector's challenges, potential solutions, and associated value propositions. Ideas generated from these interviews are structured and added to the Ideas Portal. The podcast has different hosts specialized on the various verticals, which differentiate the episodes. Examples of episodes could be “Climatetech with Ale #1: Pascal Kuhn - future of BESS, EPC companies, energy regulation in Europe” or “Automotive with Sam #3: Leonardo Scalpi - CEO Ferrari talks about F1, new ways of modelling fluid dynamics, EVs”.
- Deep-dives: A collection of in-depth articles exploring specific ideas, published also on Medium and Substack. These weekly vertical-specific analyses may evolve to also become a newsletter.
- Resources: A curated collection of useful external resources that help users explore related industries in greater depth.

### Objectives and Goals

**Primary Objective:** Develop an MVP of *The Way Forward* that captures and organizes startup ideas, enabling users to upvote/downvote, comment, and indicate interest in collaboration.

Goals include:

- Provide a user-friendly interface for capturing, browsing, and discussing startup ideas.
- Ensure ideas can be easily filtered by category, subcategory, difficulty, or popularity.
- Offer a freemium model: free access to ideas, plus premium subscriptions or pay-per-idea contact features.
- Create the foundational structure of the platform including the 4 main pillars (Ideas Portal, Podcast, Deep-dives, Resources) and integrate them more and more step-by-step

## Product Features and Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Ideas Portal page**
    - Users can submit ideas directly on the platform (with mandatory fields like title, category, difficulty, etc.).
    - Interviews uploaded (by the “curators”, which have access to a different additional view respect to “normal” users) can automatically generate multiple ideas, all linked to the associated podcast/interview.
    - Automated AI agent to collect startup ideas from public platforms (Reddit, LinkedIn, X, etc.).
    - Mandatory fields for each idea include:
    Title, Category, Sub-category, Difficulty level, Date of creation, Date of last update, Problem Statement, Solution, Why now, Market estimate, Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), Competition, Business Model, Sources, Status, Type of Creator (user, curator, agent…), Creator.
    - Optional fields include:
    Skills required, Potential investors, Conferences, Steps suggested, Eventual revisions, Collaboration Groups (Reddit, Discord…).
    - Upvote/downvote system for each idea (similar to Reddit).
    - Comment section under each idea for detailed discussion.
    - Ability to form an "interest bucket" or group for each idea to facilitate collaboration among interested users.
    - Various browsing sections: Curated Selection, Users’ Choice, Category-based listing, Newest ideas.
    - Search and filtering by category, subcategory, difficulty, and popularity.
2. **Podcast pages**
    - Curators exclusively can add content here, and should be enabled to do so in an easy and intuitive way
    - Here only the links to spotify and youtube are hosted. it includes also links to the ideas in the Ideas Portal extrapolated from these interviews
3. **Deep-dive page**
    - Curators exclusively can add content here, and should be enabled to do so in an easy and intuitive way
    - Authors can directly write on the portal in an intuitive manner, which is kept simple by design (a simpler version of how text is formatted in notion, medium or substack, including the ability to add images and videos in the middle of text if needed)
4. **Resources page**
    - Curators exclusively can add content here, and should be enabled to do so in an easy and intuitive way
    - simply a list of resources divided per industry, with a brief description of why they are useful
5. **Split between “users” and “curators” views**
    - for each page, there are 2 different views. The users, subscribed or not, can only have a certain, limited capability to interact with the Ideas Portal, and can only view the content in the Podcast, Deep-dive, and Resources pages. On the other side, Curators have a much deeper capability to interact with the Ideas Portal page (e.g., can select “Curator’s choice ideas”, can spin up agents to look for new ideas), and are for now the only ones that can modify the contents inn the Podcasts, Deep-dive, and Resources pages.
6. **Premium Modes**
    - Users can access all ideas for free but require a premium subscription or one-time payment to contact the idea owner directly.
    - in the future, it will be added a functionality that by describing an idea you have with simple text, an AI agent makes an analysis of it on the web and comes back with a properly structured idea in the style of the ones available in the ideas portal
    - Payment options: Monthly subscription (unlimited contact) or per-idea access (higher one-off cost).
7. **Content Promotion**
    - Automatic generation of social media posts highlighting top ideas or curated picks.
    - Occasional hackathons/events hosted to spur collaboration on top ideas.
8. **Multi-Channel Publishing**
    - Ability to embed or link podcast interviews on YouTube and Spotify.
    - Automated cross-posting of new or trending ideas to social channels.
9. **Fostering Early Engagement**
